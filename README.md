The project implements three LED effects for the ones in the board PICDEM2 PLUS (Microchip). It uses 6 LEDs connected to RB6, RB5, RB4, RB3, RB2 and RB1 and the buttons connected to RA4 and RB0. It also uses the three 7-segment displays on the board.

The LEDs will swich between effects when pressing RA4. RB0 increments the effect period by tenth of a second.
